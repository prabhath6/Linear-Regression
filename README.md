# Linear-Regression

This is an attempt made by me to learn Machine learning topic linear regression using python.

### Modules Used

1. Sklearn
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib


Pandas is used to analyse the data convert into data frames for data manipulation. Numpy and sklearn are used to implement the linear regression on the data set to predict the price of house in boston area. 
Seaborn and matplotlib are used for data visualization. At the end we will be plotting residual plots to check whether the data is suitable for applying linear regression or not.

###Some of the plots are shown below:

#### House_vs_price
